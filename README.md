# Data Standards Authority

# Who we are
We're the Data Standards Authority team, working to improve how the public sector manages data. We're establishing standards, writing guidance and building things to make it easier and more effective to share and use data across government. 

You can find us in #data-standards-authority on the UK Goverment Digital Slack, or email us at data-standards-authority@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
